# Logging

The server logs are sent to [Seq](https://datalust.co). You can access its [UI](http://localhost:5341) to check the logs. When you open the Seq UI for the first time, you will need to enter a username and password. The username is `admin`, and the password is provided in the `.env.production` or `.env.development` file under the `SEQ_FIRSTRUN_ADMINPASSWORD` variable.
